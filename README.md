# Gig Radio

## Listen to music by artists who are playing near you tonight.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/gig-radio](https://assembly.com/gig-radio).

## Building

This should work out of the box in the simulator. Berlin is the default simulated location.

Don't run `pod install` unless you want to fix bugs arising from library version changes (most likely in Realm).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
