/// share a single instance of SharedGroup. Instead, each concurrently
/// executing thread or process must use a separate instance of

/// Each instance of SharedGroup manages a single transaction at a
/// time. That transaction can be either a read transaction, or a
/// write transaction.

/// to make it safe and easy to work with transactions in a scoped
/// manner (by means of the RAII idiom). However, transactions can
/// also be explicitly started (begin_read(), begin_write()) and
/// stopped (end_read(), commit(), rollback()).
///
/// If a transaction is active when the SharedGroup is destroyed, that
/// transaction is implicitely terminated, either by a call to
/// end_read() or rollback().
///
/// Two processes that want to share a database file must reside on
